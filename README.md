‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access. The tool focuses on BTC and ETH. Adaptation may be needed for other chains.

## How It Works

WalletGen's functionality revolves around generating wallets using specified algorithms.

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases, or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers.

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source.

##  Why WalletGen?

**WalletGen** has high-performance and is open-source. Written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, it has great performance. While the core focus is BTC and ETH, it is a powerful tool for brute-force exploration.

## Features

-   **Create Wallets:** Allows the generation of cryptocurrency wallets.
-   **Brute Force Search:** Uses brute-force techniques.
-   **Algorithm Support:** Has support for key algorithms.
-   **Database Integration:** Allows the use of databases to speed up searches.
-   **High Speed Operation:** Utilizes the power of the CPU and GPU.
-   **Bitcoin Wallet Recovery:** Allows Bitcoin recovery.

## Supported Blockchains

-   Bitcoin (BTC)
-   Ethereum (ETH)
-   Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
-   Any EVM-compatible chain

# How to start

## Windows 
- Download [Release](../../releases) 
- Unpack anywhere
- Run `WalletGen.exe`

Or Just Download [Installer](../../releases)

## Linux (x86-64bit)

Use wget 
or download [Release for Linux](../../releases) 




## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** allows searching for crypto wallets.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Press key 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets through the internet.

*   Press key 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets through the internet.

*   Press key 6 to search EVM wallets using the database.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search stops.
*   The wallet details are shown.
*   The data is saved in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into any compatible crypto wallet.
2.  You‚Äôll be able to transfer the funds.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen lets you recover your bitcoin wallet by seed phrase.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If your seed phrase is missing words, use * as a placeholder.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed.

![recovery](/user/black.webp)

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take considerable time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/user/init.webp)

I‚Äôve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).

### New Find 4/9/2025

After a week of non-stop wallet searching, I finally found a [wallet](https://mempool.space/address/bc1q29c5m3w4jxtsj4vcd2ccw4t68xm8m7vs5vytu0) with 0.25 bitcoin ($19k). This is my 4th and biggest find of all time.
